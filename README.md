This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

With this app you can search Github users and view their profiles and repos.
At first the app was build without Hooks and Context API. They were added later.

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
